##### This repository is part of the next few assignments that I will be doing \(this will be updated as more information arrives.) I am a programmer that is currently studying Java at Southwest Technical College. I am wanting to take the skills that I am learning in this course to be able to create video games and or anyother software that I would find fasinating. I want to become an unexpendable programmer, able to work on any project and doing so at a quick speed thoroughly.
